## Goals for this project
The overall goal for this project was to provide a tool to Codaisseur graduates
whereby they could gain useful information regarding job applications. The app
will allow graduates to gain insight into previous graduates experiences when 
applying to companies in the Netherlands. More precisely, the app gives a basic
overview such as, how many previous graduates have applied to a company, whether 
they had an interview, and whether they got hired. 

In  order to do this we used the [Huntr API](https://docs.huntr.co/) for previous
graduates data and job postings.

One of the main goals in the continuation of this project was to implement a [Webhook](https://docs.huntr.co/) with the Huntr API, so the database of the app would update automatically everytime a graduate inputs new data.

Another goal was to scrap the job postings from [Indeed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/indeed-scraper) from the previous group, and replace the job postings with data from the Huntr API. 

For a better user experiece we implemented more filter options when searching for an overview of a company,
and changed the display of graduates data of a company to display statistics directly on a card for an easier overview. 
We also added a graduates page with a chart displaying how many applications and interviews it takes on average to get a job offer.

As user experience improvement we implemented role and city filters on the job page and displayed further statistics about average numbers of applications and interviews on member basis.
